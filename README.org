Reading list management using org-mode

[[file:./screen.gif]]

- Set path to reading list ~(setq org-books-file "~/my-list.org")~. Create a new
  file using function ~org-books-create-file~.

- To add books manually, use ~org-books-add-book~ function. To add from
  goodreads/amazon urls, call ~org-books-add-url~ or use ~org-books-cliplink~ if url
  is in clipboard.

- To give ratings, go to the entry and call ~org-books-rate-book~.

- While filing a book, ~org-books-file-depth~ tells which headings are to be
  considered as a category (like fiction or something).

- ~org-books-add-to-top~ (default ~t~) tells whether to add the book at the top or
  bottom under the selected heading.
